    README for Perl module Slurp

This simple module serves one purpose - to provide a simple means to
read (or slurp) an entire file into memory for processing.

But before using this module you should first look at File::Slurper,
which is a modern implementation of the idea, with proper support for
UTF-8 and IO layers.

You can read a nicely formatted version of the documentation for
this module online:

    https://metacpan.org/pod/Slurp

You should be able to install this using your usual method for installing
modules from CPAN. If you don't have one, have a look at:
